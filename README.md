# IBRtools 
# 
#### This R package was developed to perform important indexes in biomonitoring, the IBR (Integrated Biomarker Response) and IBRv2 (Integrated Biological Response version 2).
#
#
## How to install
#
#### install.packages("devtools")
#### library(devtools)
#
## 1) Directly in R with devtools
#
#### devtools::install_github("annaresende/IBRtools")
#
## 2) Downloading the zip version from this repository
####  Code -> Download zip -> Unzip it in your computer and open the directory IBRtools -> run the code devtools::install() -> update the packages as requested 
#
## 3) "It's still not working"
# 
#### Don't worry, it might be a version problem. I've come to the knowledge that it's not working for R versions above 4.0.2, so you have two options:
#### Downgrade your R program OR simply create a free account in RStudio Cloud
(*The simpler is just use it in Rstudio Cloud and then export the files you want to save in your computer later on*)
#
#### If you still come accross a new issue, please report it so we can fix it asap.
